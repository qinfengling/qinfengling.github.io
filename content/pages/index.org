Qin Fengling is an Open Source Software Engineer working on embedded hardware systems and the Blockchain.

I am the software firmware architect for Canaan Creative Avalon Bitcoin Miner for the Avalon 3, 4, 6, and 7 series computers.

I am a contributor to OpenWRT, cgminer, and all Canaan Creative Avalon Open Source projects.

I speak internationally about Open Source, Embedded Systems, and the Blockchain.

For fun, I write code for FPGA, and other hardware projects.
